# What is Patolli?
[Patolli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patolli) is an ancient board game originating in pre-Columbian Meso-America. It is played by 2-4 players
on a 2D board shaped like a cross. The goal is to traverse the entire board with all
your pieces before your opponent does the same. The pieces move based on a die-roll and always in a
clock-wise movement pattern.

Each player has his own start and end points. There are a few special squares on which different mechanics apply. The squares
at the ends of the cross (marked red squares) grant an additional turn to the player whose piece ended
its move there. The four squares in the middle are the only squares on which capturing an opponentâ€™s
piece is possible.

This is the result of a final project for the second semester C++ class at my university.
